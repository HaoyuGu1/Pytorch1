# Learn PyTorch

The purpose of this repo is to create education materials on PyTorch for model fitting.
The materials are oragnized as course number from 101, 201, etc..

Here are some summaries
101 We start from using a numpy to fit a linear model, then we use PyTorch utilities to simplify the work
201 This is the MINST example building a deep neural network for hand writting zip code recognition.
